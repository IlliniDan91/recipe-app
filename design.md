# Recipe Web App Design Document

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design for a recipe web application using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The app will allow users to view, create, edit, and delete recipes, as well as search for recipes based on various criteria.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Frontend (React)

The frontend will be built using React, providing a responsive and interactive user interface. Key components include:

- **Recipe List:** Displays all recipes with basic information
- **Recipe Detail:** Shows full recipe information
- **Recipe Form:** For creating and editing recipes
- **Search Component:** Allows users to search for recipes
- **Navigation:** For moving between different sections of the app

### 2.2 Backend (Node.js)

The backend will be built using Node.js with Express.js as the web application framework. It will handle:

- API endpoints for CRUD operations on recipes
- Search functionality
- Data validation and error handling

### 2.3 Database

MongoDB will be used as the database to store recipe information. Mongoose will be used as an ODM (Object Document Mapper) to interact with MongoDB from Node.js.

## 3. Data Model

### 3.1 Recipe Schema

{
title: String,
description: String,
ingredients: [String],
instructions: [String],
prepTime: Number,
cookTime: Number,
servings: Number,
tags: [String],
image: String,
createdAt: Date,
updatedAt: Date
}

text

## 4. API Endpoints

- GET /api/recipes: Retrieve all recipes
- GET /api/recipes/:id: Retrieve a specific recipe
- POST /api/recipes: Create a new recipe
- PUT /api/recipes/:id: Update an existing recipe
- DELETE /api/recipes/:id: Delete a recipe
- GET /api/recipes/search: Search for recipes based on query parameters

## 5. User Interface

### 5.1 Main Pages

- Home Page: Displays featured recipes and search bar
- Recipe List Page: Shows all recipes with pagination
- Recipe Detail Page: Displays full recipe information
- Create/Edit Recipe Page: Form for adding or editing recipes

### 5.2 Components

- Header: Navigation menu and search bar
- Footer: Links to about, contact, and social media
- Recipe Card: Displays recipe preview in list view
- Search Results: Shows recipes matching search criteria

## 6. Features

- Create, read, update, and delete recipes
- Search recipes by title, ingredients, or tags
- Filter recipes by preparation time, cooking time, or servings
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop use
- Image upload for recipe photos

## 7. Future Enhancements

- User authentication and personalized recipe collections
- Rating and review system for recipes
- Social sharing features
- Meal planning and grocery list generation

## 8. Technology Stack

- Frontend: React, React Router, Axios
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose
- Additional: Multer for image uploads, Jest for testing

## 9. Development Workflow

1. Set up the project structure for both frontend and backend
2. Implement the backend API endpoints and database interactions
3. Develop the frontend components and integrate with the backend
4. Implement search and filter functionality
5. Add image upload capability
6. Conduct thorough testing and bug fixes
7. Deploy the application to a hosting platform
